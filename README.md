## About 

In line with this edition of the Hackathon, we have decided to develop an interactive game based on the importance of environmental cleanliness. To achieve this, we have developed a game whereby players must sort through various randomly generated items of rubbish that which they can then deem recyclable or not. In tandem with this, players will be up against a time parameter with players that finish the game in a shorter period achieving a higher position on the overall leader board. 
The overall goal of this game is to drive home a newfound knowledge base for recyclable goods. Players will be continuously learning about which pieces of rubbish are environmentally friendly to recycle whilst conversely noting which pieces of rubbish aren’t. Of course, the leader board is there to gauge each player’s skill level, but the main takeaway is that players are enjoying themselves, gaining knowledge of the environment around them and that hopefully, they can provide this newfound understanding to those around them. 




# User Experience Design

## Strategy

### Target Audience

For our project the intention is to mainly advertise the game to the younger generations mainly within the age bracket of 6-12 years old. In particular, the demographic the project is aimed at is for those that want to learn more about the enivornment around them. 
The following areas were looked into in order to ahieve this goal of obtaining this age demographic: Gamification, Interactivity and Visual and Audio cues. A combination and the correct use of all four allows for the target audience to be attracted towards the project. The different difficulty levels provides for prolonged interest in the game itself also.

### Color Scheme

A variety of colours were tested before settling on a combination that incorporated complementary colours that were bold, modern and most importantly fun, since the target audience is young children. 

The background colour for the navigation and footer was chosen for contrast - against the navigation content as well as the screen content, since the nav and footer are always fixed.
