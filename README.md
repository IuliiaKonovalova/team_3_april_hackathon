## About 

In line with this edition of the Hackathon, we have decided to develop an interactive game based on the importance of environmental cleanliness. To achieve this, we have developed a game whereby players must sort through various randomly generated items of rubbish that which they can then deem recyclable or not. In tandem with this, players will be up against a time parameter with players that finish the game in a shorter period achieving a higher position on the overall leader board. 
The overall goal of this game is to drive home a newfound knowledge base for recyclable goods. Players will be continuously learning about which pieces of rubbish are environmentally friendly to recycle whilst conversely noting which pieces of rubbish aren’t. Of course, the leader board is there to gauge each player’s skill level, but the main takeaway is that players are enjoying themselves, gaining knowledge of the environment around them and that hopefully, they can provide this newfound understanding to those around them.
