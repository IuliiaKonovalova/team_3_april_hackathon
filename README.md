## About 

In line with this edition of the Hackathon, we have decided to develop an interactive game based on the importance of environmental cleanliness. To achieve this, we have developed a game whereby players must sort through various randomly generated items of rubbish that which they can then deem recyclable or not. In tandem with this, players will be up against a time parameter with players that finish the game in a shorter period achieving a higher position on the overall leader board. 
The overall goal of this game is to drive home a newfound knowledge base for recyclable goods. Players will be continuously learning about which pieces of rubbish are environmentally friendly to recycle whilst conversely noting which pieces of rubbish aren’t. Of course, the leader board is there to gauge each player’s skill level, but the main takeaway is that players are enjoying themselves, gaining knowledge of the environment around them and that hopefully, they can provide this newfound understanding to those around them. 




# User Experience Design

## Strategy

### Target Audience

For our project the intention is to mainly advertise the game to the younger generations mainly within the age bracket of 6-12 years old. In particular, the demographic the project is aimed at is for those that want to learn more about the enivornment around them. 
The following areas were looked into in order to ahieve this goal of obtaining this age demographic: Gamification, Interactivity and Visual and Audio cues. A combination and the correct use of all four allows for the target audience to be attracted towards the project. The different difficulty levels provides for prolonged interest in the game itself also.


### User Stories:

#### First Time Visitor Goals:
- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the purpose of the website, so I can decide whether I want to use it or not.
- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate the website, so I can find what I am looking for.
- As a first time visitor, I want to be able to easily understand the rules of the game, so I can play freely.

#### Frequent User Goals:
- As a frequent user, I want to be able to learn about sorting garbage for recycling, so I can recycle my garbage in real life.
- As a frequent user, I want to enjoy the game, so I can play it regularly.
- As a frequent user, I want to be able to compete with other users, so I can motivate myself to play the game.
- As a frequent user, I want to be able to change the theme of the game, so I can enjoy a different experience.
- As a frequent user, I want to be able to learn interesting facts about the environment, so I can improve my recycling habits.

#### Parent Goals:
- As a parent of a frequent user, I want to be sure that the content is safe for children, so I can freely let my child play the game.
- As a parent of a frequent user, I want to be sure that the is no advertisement, so I can freely let my child play the game.
- As a parent of a frequent user, I want to know that my child develops good recycling habits, so I can be sure that my child will be able to recycle in real life.
- As a parent of a frequent user, I want to be sure that my child is not addicted to the game, so I can be sure that my child will be able to play the game regularly. (for the future development)
- As a parent of a frequent user, I want to be sure that my child is motivated to play the game, so I can be sure that my child receives enough motivation to recycle and actively participate in preserving our environment.
- As a parent of a frequent user, I want my child to learn additional facts about the environment, so I can be sure that my child will be able to improve his recycling habits.

## Design

### Structure

### Color Scheme

A variety of colours were tested before settling on a combination that incorporated complementary colours that were bold, modern and most importantly fun, since the target audience is young children. 

The background colour for the navigation and footer was chosen for contrast - against the navigation content as well as the screen content, since the nav and footer are always fixed.

## Technologies Used


## Testing

[Click Here](TESTING.md) to view the full testing steps that were completed on every device and browser.

## Deployment

### Github
The repository was first created by logging into a GitHub account:

Clicking the 'new' green button.

This then prompts to another page with asks for a name for the new repositary. Above this input there is a dropdown menu offering a selection of various templates to utilise with the repository. The Code Institute template was chosen in order to faciliate all the shortcuts included within it to make my workflow as fast as possible.

**How to fork the GitHub Repository**

### Cloning and Forking 

In order to clone the repository, the user must visit the repository page.

Cloning by command line: Click the button beside the green button titled 'code', there you will be given various options on how you would like to clone the repository. You must then type 'git clone' into your own workspace along with the repo URL and enter.

### Forking

Go to the repositary page. In the top right of the page, below the navbar, click the 'fork' button. The fork should now be in your repositories.
